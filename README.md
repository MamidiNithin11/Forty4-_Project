# User Management Dashboard

This project is a full-stack user management dashboard application. It provides functionalities to add, view, update, and delete user information. The application is built with a Node.js Express backend and a React frontend.

## Features

- User creation with form validation
- Displaying a list of users
- Editing existing user details
- Deleting users

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**
- React
- Vite
- Axios for API calls
- Tailwind CSS for styling

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQLite (using `sqlite3` package) for database management

## Getting Started

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the full-stack application, you need to start both the backend and the frontend servers separately.

1.  **Start Backend:**
    Open a terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Start Frontend:**
    Open another terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The frontend application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
